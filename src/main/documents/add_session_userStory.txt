Adding a Session
---------------------
As an admin, I would like to add a new session for a program, including the courses, class meeting datetimes and instructors.
Sometimes I will want to build the session from scratch.
Other times I will want to copy from a previous session of the same program.

I will want to add existing courses and instructors already in the system.
I will also want to add new courses and instructors as I define the session.

I would like to view the entire session definition with all of the courses, instructors and class datetimes.
I would like to view all of the class datetimes in a calendar.

I would like to view a list of all of the sessions in the system, searchable by program, session name, dates.

Steps:

1.	Select a program
2.  Enter a session name and start/end dates
3.	Add a course
	a.  Add a new course not in the system yet
	b.  Pick a course from the system list
	c.  Pick a course from a previous session
	d.  Multiselect with ability to add or inherit class and instructor details
4.	Define classes for each course:
	a.  Total hours
	b.  Total class number
	c.  Instructor for class if different than the one defined at the course level.
